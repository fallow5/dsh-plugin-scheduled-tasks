# @opendsh/dsh-plugin-scheduled-tasks

DSH web plugin: **per-project automation tasks with prompts**. Create a task in the
sidebar (⏰ 自动化任务), give it a prompt, and the plugin runs that prompt on
schedule — as a fresh headless agent session in the project directory — then
records the outcome as durable run history.

## What it does

- **Workspace-scoped tasks** — each task belongs to a workspace directory (a DSH
  workspace). The panel lists tasks for the selected workspace.
- **Three schedule kinds**
  - `cron` (周期) — run on a cron calendar rule. The form offers presets
    (daily / weekly / monthly) with a time picker, or a custom five/six/seven-
    field expression (e.g. `0 9 * * 1-5`), evaluated in an explicit IANA time
    zone, DST-aware.
  - `every` (按间隔) — run on a fixed creation-anchored interval (≥ 5 minutes);
    missed intervals are never replayed, only the latest due occurrence runs.
  - `at` (单次) — run once at an absolute time (strict RFC 3339 instant, or a
    local date/time with an explicit IANA time zone; DST gaps are rejected,
    overlaps pick the earlier instant).
- **Effective date range** — each task may optionally carry an `effectiveFrom`
  and/or `effectiveUntil` date. The scheduler skips tasks outside their range
  and finishes tasks whose end date has passed. Leave both blank for always.
- **Prompt execution** — on schedule, a brand-new agent session is created in
  the workspace directory with the task's prompt and driven to quiescence (the
  same drive pattern as `dsh --profile headless`). The run session appears
  in the workspace's conversation list with a pinned title (`⏰ <task name>`) and
  stays resumable; the final assistant text is also captured into the run record.
- **Per-task model override** — each task may pin an explicit
  provider/model selection, picked from the grouped provider catalog in the
  panel (the same groups the DSH model selector renders, with the current
  default selection shown as the first option). Runs then use that model
  instead of the deployment default; the effective model of every run is
  recorded in its history. Leaving the picker empty follows the default
  selection.
- **Run history** — status (`running` / `completed` / `failed`), start/finish
  times, output (truncated at 20 KB), error messages; newest first, capped at
  20 records per task (configurable).
- **Manual run-now** — runs a task immediately without touching its schedule.
- **Lifecycle semantics**
  - Runs only while the DSH web process is alive. After a restart, overdue
    one-shots run once and are marked `overdue`; overdue `every` tasks run only
    their latest due occurrence.
  - One-shot `at` tasks finish after their single run; `every` tasks stay
    active and advance to the next anchor-aligned target.
  - Tasks with an `effectiveUntil` date are automatically finished once the
    end date has passed.

## Architecture

A dual-face npm package installed into the `web` profile:

| Half     | Entry           | Role                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Server   | `lib/index.js`  | Cordis plugin: opens the `scheduled_tasks` storage domain (`ctx.storageDomain`), mounts the task store, the scheduler (bounded timers, clock-rollback-safe wakes), the headless executor, and the `ctx.tasks` typert service. |
| Protocol | `lib/typert.js` | Host TYPERT face (`tasks/*` endpoints), auto-registered by `dsh-typert-loader`.                                                                                                                                               |
| Browser  | `lib/client.js` | React panel mounted into the `sidebar.footer.action` slot; calls the host through the installed `remote.tasks` namespace.                                                                                                     |

The client↔server channel is the DSH typert protocol (the same mechanism
`dsh-commands` uses): strict zod codecs validate every argument and result on
both sides, and no session needs to exist for the panel to work.

## Install

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add @opendsh/dsh-plugin-scheduled-tasks
```

## Development

```sh
pnpm --dir src/plugins/dsh-plugin-scheduled-tasks typecheck   # tsc (TypeScript 7)
pnpm --dir src/plugins/dsh-plugin-scheduled-tasks test        # vitest
pnpm --dir src/plugins/dsh-plugin-scheduled-tasks build       # tsc emit + tsdown client bundle + loader wrapper
```

After changing sources, rebuild and re-sync the profile copy
(`pnpm install` inside the profile re-copies `file:` dependencies), then
restart `dsh web` — the plugin has no HMR channel.

## Configuration

| Key                 | Default | Meaning                                                               |
| ------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `maxConcurrentRuns` | `2`     | Maximum concurrently running agent sessions across all tasks.         |
| `keepRunsPerTask`   | `20`    | Run-history records retained per task (oldest pruned beyond the cap). |

## Troubleshooting

Tool calls that fail with “Interrupted: interrupted” (underlying error
`Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'prepare')`) are almost always a
duplicate `@deepseek-ai/dsh-tools` copy caused by declaring DSH packages in
`dependencies` instead of `peerDependencies`. See
[`docs/troubleshooting.md`](docs/troubleshooting.md) for the full write-up.

## Limitations

- Schedules fire only while the web process is running (same posture as
  `dsh-schedule`); there is no external wake-up when the process is down.
- Each run consumes model tokens with the task's pinned model, or the current
  default model when the task pins none — the panel says so explicitly.
- Run history is refreshed by polling while the panel is open (10 s interval);
  push updates are deferred work.
